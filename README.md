<br>
It is a web-based application to analyze the state of the art models based on their susceptibility against various adversarial attacks and also to find a model perfect for user's needs according to the dataset. 
<br>

# Features
- Visualize the classification task by the various state of the art models with your own images.
- The input images can be either uploaded from local storage or image link.
- Test out various adversarial attacks on your image and check the misclassification.
- Visualize, compare and contrast the classification on the image before and after the attack.
- Would help one to analyze which model is better for their personal use.
